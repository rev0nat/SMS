        **************************
        
        This Python package contains modules useful for celestial mechanics and in particular for orbital flight. 
        
        Last update: 2020/04/22 by Alexis Petit, Delphine Ly, Gabriel Magnaval.
        
        * Version 1.0.0: Initial version from CelestialPy (constants, coordinates, time scales, TLE).
        * Version 1.0.1: Add coordinate and frame transformations using Orekit.
        * Version 1.0.2: Determination of the satellite coordinate systems RSW and NWT as defined by Vallado, 2013, p.157. 
        * Version 1.0.3: Modification of the keys.
        * Version 1.0.4: Vectorization of the conversion modules. Add arguments in the TLE reader.
        * Version 1.0.5: Reference frame transformation (with Orekit and Astropy).
        * Version 1.0.6: Computation of the collision probability.
